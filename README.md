# Quality-Control-Chart-Automation-for-Hospitals-Across-USA
Process Automation for plotting Control Charts for chosen measures and list of Hospitals after web scrapping the data from CMS Website

# Problem Statement:
Department of Health Administration and Policy, GMU uses Control Chart to compare the parameters of Hospitals. Before this project, the process was manual, repetitive, and time-consuming which involves downloading the data from CMS website, filtering the data in Excel, computing, and then analyzing. The process was redundant.

# Solution:
When executed with proper parameters, the R code will generate the Quality Control Charts. The code will take care of web scraping the data from CMS website to visualize the Graphs.

# Data Source:
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/sites/default/files/archive/Hospitals/
